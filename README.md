# KHReCoMTiled
This is a project file and extension code for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). To use it, you must place the file `SYS\0001\SY0001.BIN` from your ReCoM extraction in the folder next to the `recom.tiled-project` file. Load the project in Tiled, then select the story whose floors you want to edit from the list on the left. The various floors of the castle will appear in the Layers list on the right, all invisible by default. You can add, edit, and remove floors and rooms as desired, though additional floors will require extra work to be usable, and missing floors will likely crash the game. Make sure all floor layers are using the `Floor` class, and all rooms are using the `Room` class, and ensure each of them has a unique `ID` set (per-floor in the case of rooms). Note that a floor should not have more than 30 rooms in it, as that seems to be a hard-coded limit in the game.
